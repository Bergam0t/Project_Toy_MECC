# Toy MECC

*This is a project for the HSMA 6 Hackday on 22nd Oct 2024*

A (toy) model for showing the benefit of Making Every Contact Count (MECC) Training

Build a steamlit app for an Agent Based Simulation

The pop culture 80's references will all be in the form of toy robots.

There is an inital group of people and an inital group of government services

People can have lifestyle factors smoking/drinking/no exercise

People make have a probability of making a quit attempt smoking/drinking/no exercise with a probability of success

People have contact with government services at random

Services have can have MECC training, and therefore a probability that any contact will lead to a Very Brief Intervention

Services with MECC training increase over time with a training rate

A Very Brief Intervention increases the probability that a patient will make a quit attempt

Outputs will be MECC training numbers, number of quit attempts and number of successful quits over time
