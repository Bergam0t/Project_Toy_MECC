# Toy MECC

A (toy) model for showing the benefit of Making Every Contact Count (MECC) Training
Build a steamlit app for an Agent Based Simulation
The pop culture 80's references will all be in the form of toy robots.
There is an inital group of people and an inital group of government services
People can have lifestyle factors smoking/drinking/no exercise
People make have a probability of making a quit attempt smoking/drinking/no exercise with a probability of success
People have contact with government services at random
Services have can have MECC training, and therefore a probability that any contact will lead to a Very Brief Intervention
Services with MECC training increase over time with a training rate
A Very Brief Intervention increases the probability that a patient will make a quit attempt
Outputs will be MECC training numbers, number of quit attempts and number of successful quits over time
